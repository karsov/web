Last week was packed with AI-related announcements! Keep reading to discover them, along with updates from my favourite #observability topic,
and don't forget to check the mandatory #Golang bonus content in the comments.

ü§ñ First, it was Slack who introduced their vision for generative AI called ‚ÄúSlack GPT‚Äù.
It includes AI-powered features like conversation summaries and writing assistance built directly into the application,
as well as a new AI-ready platform for seamless integration and automation with your preferred language model. Find out more about it here:

ü§ñ Next, Google I/O was (almost) all about AI. They unveiled PaLM 2 - a new large language model with better multilingual and reasoning capabilities,
offering enhanced speed and computational efficiency. Among the many Google products using this new model is Duet AI - a new collaborator for Google Cloud and Workspace.
Its features range from code and chat assistance inside your IDE to text and image generation inside your mails, documents and slides (however access is currently limited).
Furthermore, new models and APIs were added to the Vertex AI platform. Also, Bard, Google‚Äôs generative AI chatbot,
expanded its access to over 180 countries (excluding Europe unfortunately). Explore all the announcements here:

ü§ñ Joining the AI race, IBM presented their upcoming AI and data platform watsonx. Once available, watsonx will have 3 components:
a studio for training, validating, tuning, and deploying foundation and machine learning models, a data store for analytics and AI workloads,
and a governance component - to direct, manage, and monitor your organisation‚Äôs AI activities. Learn more about it here:

üìà Switching to #observability, Prometheus 2.44 was released last week. The notable highlight is that the ‚Äústringlabels‚Äù memory optimisation
introduced in the previous release is no longer experimental and now everyone can benefit from the improved resource usage.

üìñ And last but not least, Juraci Paix√£o Kr√∂hling added another great #OpenTelemetry resource focused on troubleshooting the OpenTelemetry Collector. Check it out here:

**Bonus #Golang tip:** Regardless of your expertise level, participate in the Go developer surveys.  Your input will help the team prioritise language and tooling improvements that will matter personally to you.
