Here are my highlights of the week - a couple of new announcements and a few older but very education resources:

Amazon Web Services (AWS) announced the general availability of their AWS Application Composer ‚Äì a visual builder for serverless applications.
And it looks like a great tool not only for quick prototyping but also for generating diagrams or simply learning about serverless applications:

Cloudflare shared an excellent blog post describing not only how they handle high cardinality in Prometheus
but also going in depth on what metrics and time series are and how #Prometheus handles them internally:

üôÅ The #Kubernetes Project announced that a tool I found very useful while I was starting with K8s, the free Katacoda Kubernetes tutorials,
is shutting down at the end of March:

If you've never heard of container checkpointing, it allows you to write to a file on the disk the state of a running container (including memory!)
in order for it to be restored or analysed later. Sysdig has a great article going into further details on what was added in Kubernetes 1.25
along with a lot of other useful resources:

ü§ì I found this interesting read on something #Golang devs don't usually think a lot, the goroutines size:
