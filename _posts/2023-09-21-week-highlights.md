This week I‚Äôve collected some major developments in the world of #observability, a big addition to #Neo4j, and an important change for #Golang on #AWS.

üéâ But first, the biggest news around is that #OpenTF, the recently announced #Terraform fork, just joined The Linux Foundation under a new name: OpenTofu.
It may come as a surprise that this happens only a few weeks after HashiCorp changed Terraform‚Äôs licence to limit competition,
but the energy behind the new project seems to make it poised for success.

üöÄ Switching to a topic I‚Äôm really fond of, databases, Neo4j, the leading name in the graph DB space, added native vector search.
This feature comes at a time of surge in adoption of vector databases caused by the explosion of large language models (LLMs) popularity,
because they facilitate the integration of LLM responses with factual data.

üìà Moving on to observability, the next #Prometheus version, 2.47, was released with the addition of an OpenTelemetry ingestion endpoint, among many other improvements.
And don‚Äôt forget, the biggest Prometheus event #PromCon EU is coming next week (Sep 28-29) so book the time on your calendar and check the schedule in the comments below.

üìä Still on observability, Grafana Labs unveiled a public preview of Grafana Beyla, a new tool able to auto-instrument your application with HTTP request metrics and trace spans.
And because it‚Äôs using #eBPF all of that is done without any code changes and for a wide range of programming languages.
And there‚Äôs more - Grafana Pyroscope, their continuous profiling solution, reached version 1. This means that its integration into the Grafana ecosystem is now complete
after its acquisition in March. Now, the team boasts it is ‚Äúthe most efficient and scalable open source profiling database‚Äù.

üí• Finishing this week's post with Golang, if you are using AWS lambda with the ‚Äúgo1.x‚Äù runtime and missed the news, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is deprecating it by the end of the year
along with the Amazon Linux AMI‚Äôs end-of-life. While the new ‚Äúprovided.al2‚Äù runtime may offer better performance, it requires modifications on your end.
Find in the comments a nice InfoQ article summarising the community‚Äôs reaction to the deprecation.
