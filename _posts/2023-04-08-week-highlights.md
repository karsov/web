This week, I came across some interesting educational posts that I'd like to share with you.

ðŸ’¡ Lyft Engineering blogged about how they use synthetic traffic to load test and simulate their systems behaviour during real-world peak events:

ðŸ’¡ Figma shared how they migrated from a single database to multiple ones while ensuring as smooth transition as possible:

ðŸ“– Polar Signals, the creators of the open-source continuous profiling project Parca,
posted about how to read icicle and flame graphs when debugging application performance:

ðŸ“– Grafana Labs shared a beginners guide for Prometheus-based alerting systems:

ðŸ¤“ While I was deep into refactoring a #Golang service, I found this really well written article by Anton Sankov
on the different ways to initialise Go structs:

ðŸ˜‚ To add a bit of fun to all the serious reading, last Saturday was April Fool's day.
Unfortunately, I stumbled upon a single joke only - CERN scientists proposed a 25-hour day! Check it here:

If you were luckier than me and found any other April Fool's jokes, please share them.
