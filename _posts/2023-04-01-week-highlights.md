No big news this week, yay! Here is what caught my attention though:

ðŸ’» The proposal for adding structured logging in the #Golang standard library was recently accepted
( [https://github.com/golang/go/issues/56345#issuecomment-1470506816](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/56345#issuecomment-1470506816) ).
You can check the implementation in the experimental package, although it may undergo some changes before it lands in the standard library:
[https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/exp/slog](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/exp/slog)

ðŸ’¡ While looking at the Golang experimental packages, I was surprised to find that there is an "event" package
( [https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/exp/event](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/exp/event) ),
which reminded me of this very interesting talk on having observability without logs:

I recently found out about Dragonfly - a drop-in replacement for the Redis in-memory datastore
which boasts greater performance, scalability and operational ease.

ðŸ“ˆ Grafana Labs announced the schedule for the upcoming GrafanaCON 2023.
