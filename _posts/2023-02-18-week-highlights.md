This weeks I was jumping between many topics... 


**FOSDEM'23**

#FOSDEM was just 2 weeks ago and we already have available the recordings of (most of) the talks.
Make sure to not miss the Go developer room among many other interesting tracks: [https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/tracks/](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/tracks/)


**LFX Mentorship**

LFX Mentorship is a program by the Linux Foundation offering interns and mentees the opportunity to work
on some of the world’s most popular open source projects (with stipends!!!).
The 2023 spring term mentee applications are open until Feb 21st and the participating projects include
Kubernetes, Cortex, Linkerd and WasmEdge among others. [https://github.com/cncf/mentoring/tree/main/programs/lfx-mentorship/2023/01-Mar-May](https://github.com/cncf/mentoring/tree/main/programs/lfx-mentorship/2023/01-Mar-May)


**Did you know that…**

Did you know that there are docker commands allowing you to save your Docker images in a tar file
so you can explore them outside of Docker or copy them to a different machine: [https://dockerlabs.collabnix.com/beginners/saving-images-as-tar/](https://dockerlabs.collabnix.com/beginners/saving-images-as-tar/)


**WebAssembly**

Containerd (the default container runtime in Kubernetes) recently added support for #WebAssembly containers
which makes the future of WebAssembly even more interesting: [https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/02/containerd-wasi/](https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/02/containerd-wasi/)


**ChatGPT**

ChatGPT continues to find new useful applications.
Lately it was added to Microsoft Teams to write the meeting notes for you: [https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chatgpt-generative-ai_chatgpt-artificialintelligence-activity-7027097694292561920-YmtR/](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chatgpt-generative-ai_chatgpt-artificialintelligence-activity-7027097694292561920-YmtR/)
