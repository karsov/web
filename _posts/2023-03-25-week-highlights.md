Although last week's news wasn't as big as the previous week, there were a couple of notable announcements:

ðŸ’» Maybe the thing that impacted most developers' everyday work was #GitHub rotating an RSA SSH key Friday morning (UTC)
which not only caused worries of a man-in-the-middle attack but also broke quite a few CI/CD pipelines:

ðŸ¤– OpenAI also made headlines last week with two announcements. First, GitHub announced Copilot X,
the next generation of their developer assistant now powered by GPT-4
( [https://github.blog/2023-03-22-github-copilot-x-the-ai-powered-developer-experience/](https://github.blog/2023-03-22-github-copilot-x-the-ai-powered-developer-experience/) ).
And then overnight, OpenAI turned ChatGPT into a platform by announcing ChatGPT plugins,
which some compare to an OpenAI version of the AppStore:

ðŸ“ˆ The #Prometheus project released version 2.43 of the popular monitoring application, which includes an interesting #Golang optimisation
to improve speed and memory footprint. Although the enhancement itself may not look that significant, it deserves its, first in more than a year,
post in the Prometheus blog because it had to be hidden behind a build tag and you have to do some extra work to test it:

ðŸ’¡ I also came across an interesting recent blog post by Coursera Engineering on load testing a DB by using request mirroring:

ðŸ“– Finally, I want to share a free resource with developer e-books I (re)discovered this week:

P.S. And if you missed my post from last week about DockerHub's "miscommunication" on sunsetting their free team plan
(you can check it here: [https://karsov.github.io/web/2023/03/18/week-highlights.html](https://karsov.github.io/web/2023/03/18/week-highlights.html) ),
don't worry, they are now taking a complete u-turn:
