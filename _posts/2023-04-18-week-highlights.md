My latest update is late this week because of the Orthodox Easter holidays however this may have been for the better
because this post coincides with the start of the biggest cloud-native event of the year KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2023!
It begins with my favourite Observability Day, so if you haven‚Äôt registered yet - virtual passes are still available at:

üéâ Moving back to the news from last week, the biggest for me was again Kubernetes related - the release of its version 1.27
( [https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/04/11/kubernetes-v1-27-release/](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/04/11/kubernetes-v1-27-release/) ).
It comes with a whopping 60 enhancements, but for me the most notable changes are the freeze of the k8s.gcr.io image registry and
the new ability to update a Pod‚Äôs resources without restarting it.
If you're interested in learning more, Sysdig wrote a great overview of the most important changes:

ü§ñ In other news, Amazon CodeWhisperer, AWS‚Äôs AI coding assistant, is now generally available and free for individual use.
While it seems unable to do as complex things as ChatGPT, it can definitely save you some typing.
CodeWhisperer is also the only tool that can flag code suggestions that may resemble particular open-source training data,
and also the only one with embedded security scanning. Now that you can sign up with just an email it's definitely worth checking out:

üîê In a recent blog post, the popular password manager Bitwarden revealed an open beta for a new secrets manager
to help DevOps teams in storing, managing, automating, and sharing secrets across multiple systems and services. Read more about it here:

ü§î Google Cloud also made a curious announcement recently about the tech preview of a downloadable edition
of their fully managed PostgreSQL-compatible database service AlloyDB:

üìñ Lastly, apart from the news, last week I enjoyed reading a good overview of time series data forecasting methods on The New Stack
( [https://thenewstack.io/what-is-time-series-forecasting/](https://thenewstack.io/what-is-time-series-forecasting/) ).
If you are new to time series, time series databases and why you need them, they also have a great article on that topic:
