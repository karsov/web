It seems that last week was mostly about #Observability for me. A couple of things grabbed my attention:


**AWS Observability Best Practices**

I just stumbled upon this excellent guide on observability best practices by AWS:
[https://aws-observability.github.io/observability-best-practices/](https://aws-observability.github.io/observability-best-practices/)
It has a lot of useful both generic and AWS specific information.


**Big migrations**

Gergely Orosz does a thorough review of Khan Academyâ€™s 3.5 year migration from Python monolith to multiple Go services:

**Fun fact**

Did you know that in Go strings are internally structs?

**Dynamic logging**

Dynamic logging is the ability to add log lines at runtime.
While there are already some professional solutions for interpreted languages (Lightrun, Rookout Live Logger),
for compiled languages like #Golang the functionality is just starting to appear thanks to eBPF:

**Distributed tracing**

#CNCF shared on their blog and excellent article by Tyk on distributed tracing and OpenTelemetry
